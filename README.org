* JPDB Midi Reviewer
Review on jpdb by using MIDI!
** Motivation
** How to use
- Install tampermonkey
- Enable script
- Allow jpdb to autoplay audio or you won't hear the autoplay audio anymore. eg. on firefox:
  [[./screenshot.png]]
- Look at console on the review page to see the list of midi inputs and keep in mind the number in front of the one you want
- Change `startLoggingMIDIInput(midi, 2)` to whateve the number of the correct number is for you
- (Optional): Change the notes in onMidiMessage if you want to use something else, default is C-E because it looks the same as the review screen but if you use an EWI or midi guitar or something maybe you want something else.

Reviews will happen on releasing the key, if you hold it for a few secnods before releasing you can abort.
